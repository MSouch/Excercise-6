      description: "You're in the weekly project review meeting. The turnaround is scheduled to begin in 120 days, and you're presenting your detailed schedule. The Operations Manager interrupts: \"Why is procurement execution showing up during our planning phase? Execution doesn't start for four months!\"\n\nThe Engineering Manager adds: \"And why do you have monitoring activities starting now? We're not executing anything yet!\"\n\nYour Project Manager looks concerned. The room falls silent as stakeholders question whether your planning approach aligns with established industrial practices.\n\nThe Risk: Stakeholder confidence in your planning approach is eroding due to terminology confusion between PMI Process Groups and industrial project phases."

    question: "What's your response to address this confusion?",
    options: {
      A: "Revise your schedule to move all \"executing\" activities to the physical execution phase and all \"monitoring\" activities to after execution begins",
      B: "Change all terminology to match industrial phase names to avoid confusion",

        guidingQuestion: "How can you help stakeholders understand that PMI \"executing\" processes often begin during industrial \"planning\" phases?",
        explanation: "Moving procurement to physical execution phase creates equipment delays, premium pricing, and reduced vendor competition due to compressed timelines."

      description: "You're developing the detailed turnaround plan when you realize the project charter contains significant gaps. The scope boundaries are vague (\"refurbish critical equipment\"), success criteria are generic (\"complete safely on time and budget\"), and stakeholder expectations aren't documented.\n\nYour Engineering Lead approaches: \"The operations team is asking about shutdown duration limits, but I can't find that constraint anywhere. Maintenance wants to know which equipment is truly critical versus nice-to-have, but the charter just says 'critical equipment.'\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Contracts Manager emails: \"Three contractors are asking for clarification on scope boundaries. Without clear charter requirements, they're pricing worst-case scenarios, inflating our budget by 30%.\"\n\nThe Risk: Unclear initiating process outputs are undermining your ability to create implementable plans that align with stakeholder expectations."

        guidingQuestion: "How can you use your planning expertise to improve the foundation rather than work around weak foundations?",
        explanation: "Assumptions will likely conflict with stakeholder expectations, leading to major scope changes, budget overruns, and schedule delays when misalignments surface during execution."

Environmental permits need 45 days minimum, but work is scheduled to start in 30 days.\"\n\nThe Procurement Manager adds: \"Critical valve deliveries aren't aligned with installation dates. The schedule shows installation Week 3, but valves won't arrive until Week 5.\"\n\nThe Quality Manager continues: \"Inspection resources are overallocated by 300% during peak weeks. We'll never be able to verify this much work with our team size.\"\n\nThe Risk: Functionally excellent but unintegrated planning is creating execution impossibilities that threaten the entire turnaround."
